##### Installation
1. Make sure you have Node installed. You can check by running `node -v`. If you do not, go to [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the installation instructions.
2. Install Expo. In your command line/terminal, run `npm install expo-cli --global`
3. If you haven't already, make a fork of this Github Repo, and then clone this Github Repo from your fork to your local machine. 
4. In your command line/terminal, get into the directory of this app. `cd .../AnxietyApp` 
5. Run `npm install` to download all of the app dependancies. This might take a little bit. 
6. While npm is installing stuff, it would be a good time to download the expo client. On the Apple Store or Google Play store, download the "Expo Client" on your mobile device. This will allow you to interact with the app and see changes in real time. It's *really* cool. 

##### Running the App
7. Once npm finished installing and you have downloaded the client on your phone, run the `expo start` command. This will start up the app and it should boot up in your web browser. Use your camera/QR code scanner to scan the QR code and open the app on your mobile device. 
8. In your favorite IDE, you can start making changes to the app. The best place to start is `AnxietyApp/screens/HomeScreen.js`
9. Save the file and watch the screen update in real time!
