##### Installation
1. **Node** Make sure you have Node installed. You can check by running `node -v`. If you do not, go to [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the installation instructions.
2. **Expo** After Node is installed, in your command line/terminal, run `npm install expo-cli --global`. Download the Expo Client on your phone from the App Store or Google Play.
3. If you haven't already, make a fork of this Github Repo, and then clone this Github Repo from your fork to your local machine. 
4. In your command line/terminal, get into the directory of this app. `cd .../HitPause` 
5. Run `npm install` to download all of the app dependancies. This might take a little bit. 

##### Running the App
6. Once npm finished installing and you have downloaded the client on your phone, run the `expo start` command. This will start up the app and it should boot up Expo DevTools in your web browser. Use your camera/QR code scanner to scan the QR code and open the app on your mobile device.
***If you get an error when trying to open on your phone about "unable to resolve @expo/vector-icons" let me know.***
Alternatively, you can choose to open the app in your browser and use the browser's mobile simulation features through the inspector.
7. In your favorite IDE, you can start making changes to the app. The best place to start is `HitPause/screens/HomeScreen.js`
8. Save the file and watch the screen update in real time! 

## Contributing üéâ
To contribute to this repository, please follow these steps
1. Directly clone onto your local machine. No need for all of that fancy forking stuff. 
2. Develop on your own branch. You can call it whatever you want, your own name being a good choice. 
3. *Please* Create a pull request. As the title, put the name of the story associated with the feature you are pushing. Ex for a story named "Feature - Profile Page" title the PR "Feature - Profile Page" so we can keep the backlog and the code well tracked. 
4. You can just merge the pull request yourself. 
5. Make sure you refresh the master branch on your local machine often!

## Reporting an Issue üêõ
If you came across a bug, lets handle it this way. Even if you can fix the bug right then and there, lets still do this as documentation incase it happens again, as well as practicing using an important part of github! 
1. Gather as much info as you can about what's wrong causing the bug.
2. Open an issue on Github under the "issues" tab.
3. Use [this](https://github.com/HitPauseApp/HitPause/blob/master/BugReports.md) markdown template to fill out the bug report. Click "raw" on the text window to get the markdown and copy and paste into the description of the bug report. Please provide as much detail as possible so other people know what's going on. You can copy and paste screenshots right into the document.
4. Label it. On the right column of the bug report window, click the cog wheel to add a label. If it is a bug (like it really messes with the app in some way) use the bug label. If you are just getting a warning message, use the warning label. Then choose an urgency label according to how bad the bug is and when it should be fixed (Low - can wait, moderate - should be addressed next sprint, high - needs to be fixed immediatly/this sprint).
5. Post link to issue report in the Slack channel so we know what's going on.
5. If you would like to fix the bug, you can create a story on pivotal tracker and then link to the issue (the url on the issue page) and you can get credit for it!
