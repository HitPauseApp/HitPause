##### Installation
1. **Node** Make sure you have Node installed. You can check by running `node -v`. If you do not, go to [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the installation instructions.
2. **Expo** After Node is installed, in your command line/terminal, run `npm install expo-cli --global`. Download the Expo Client on your phone from the App Store or Google Play.
3. If you haven't already, make a fork of this Github Repo, and then clone this Github Repo from your fork to your local machine. 
4. In your command line/terminal, get into the directory of this app. `cd .../HitPause` 
5. Run `npm install` to download all of the app dependancies. This might take a little bit. 

##### Running the App
6. Once npm finished installing and you have downloaded the client on your phone, run the `expo start` command. This will start up the app and it should boot up Expo DevTools in your web browser. Use your camera/QR code scanner to scan the QR code and open the app on your mobile device.
***If you get an error when trying to open on your phone about "unable to resolve @expo/vector-icons" let me know.***
Alternatively, you can choose to open the app in your browser and use the browser's mobile simulation features through the inspector.
7. In your favorite IDE, you can start making changes to the app. The best place to start is `HitPause/screens/HomeScreen.js`
8. Save the file and watch the screen update in real time!
